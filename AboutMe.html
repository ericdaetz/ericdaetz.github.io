        I'm a native of Mountain View, CA. My interest in coding languages began in my Junior year of High School, where an AP Computer Science
        course was offered. Projects in that class often focused on fun visual novelties using canvas, such as animations or games. For a couple of years during my High School days,
        I had the honor of serving senior citizens in my community by becoming a Computer Lab volunteer. At UC San Diego, I took various pre-requisite courses involving C and Java, among other languages,
        before finishing my Cognitive Science major through the usage of machine learning algorithms in Python. These days, I'm a part-time tutor in Math and English, but my 
        dream is to secure a job coding by showing my intellectual curiosity and competency through projects such as this website.
